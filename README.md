# Alex's Project: Casino

I intend to draw from my extensive background
in working at a casino to build an interactive
casino experience for web visitors.

## Intended functionality:

- Table Games

    - Blackjack
    - Roulette
    - Baccarat
    - Pai-Gao Poker (This one will be _complicated_)
    - Maybe some 'circus' games
        - Let It Ride
        - Texas Hold'em Bonus
        - High-Card Flush

- Bingo

    - Single-Line
    - Double-line
    - Full-house
    - Small-house
    - Any-9-Block
    - Maybe others

- Slots
    - I have no experience in this category.
    - I will likely have to consult for info

## Immediate Future:

- I'll need to acquire certain assets

    - Images
        - Card images/sprites
        - Table layout images/sprites
        - "Mood" artwork

- Focus on Table Games to start

    - This is where I have the strongest experience. I should be able to do _most_ of this work myself
    - Roulette will _likely_ be the easiest to start, but not if I intend to include animations.
        - Blackjack would probably be next best.

- Work out some of the basic game logistics
    - User agency
        - Money and/or chips
        - Card handling
        - Ability to leave/join different tables
        - Learning the rules of play
            - Getting advice on optimal strategies (Probably a longer-term objective. Not terribly important to functionality)
    - Debug Mode
        - For the purpose of getting things working, I'd like to add a 'debug' mode (that can be flipped on/off with a button) that will reveal helpful details about what's happening.

## Longer-term Targets:

- Building an engine that can read poker hand strengths.
    - This will allow us to run Pai-Gow Poker, as well as most of the circus games.
- Learning animation.
    - Many aspects of a casino are predicated on how they look:
        - Roulette wheel spinning, with ball going around
        - Cards 'pitched' to players
        - Sliding of chips
        - Jackpot lights
    - Sounds can be just as important
        - Clattering of chips
        - Jackpot sirens/bells
        - Roulette ball
        - Card shuffling
